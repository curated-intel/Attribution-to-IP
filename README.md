# Attribution to IP
- A collection of methods to learn who the owner of an IP address is.
- The reason for this could be for the IP being victimised in an attack, being currently compromised, or having security misconfigurations and could be attacked.
- These methods are useful for cyber threat intelligence (CTI) analysts performing victim notifications or security researchers working on bug bounty programs.

| Autonomous System Names (ASNs) | ASNs describe ownership of blocks of IP addresses. Helps identify the ISP, hosting provider, or large organization behind a network. | [Team Cymru](https://v4.whois.cymru.com/cgi-bin/whois.cgi) / [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) / [InfoByIP](https://www.infobyip.com/) / [IPQS](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/) / [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) / [FOFA](https://en.fofa.info/) / [Censys](https://search.censys.io/) / [Onyphe](https://search.onyphe.io/) / [Modat](https://modat.io) / [Odin](https://odin.io/) / [IPVOID](https://www.ipvoid.com/) / [Cloudflare Radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com/ip) / [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) / [Driftnet](https://driftnet.io/search/summary)  / [ZoomEye](https://www.zoomeye.ai/) |
| IP Geolocation | Maps IP to approximate physical location. Helps determine country or city, which may assist in narrowing the scope of who the owner is. | [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo) / [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) / [InfoByIP](https://www.infobyip.com/) / [IPQS](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/) / [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) / [FOFA](https://en.fofa.info/) / [Censys](https://search.censys.io/) / [Onyphe](https://search.onyphe.io/) / [Odin](https://odin.io/) / [IPVOID](https://www.ipvoid.com/) / [Cloudflare Radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com/ip) |
| Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) | BGP announcements tell you who is routing the IP block and confirms the autonomous system or network managing the address. | [BGP Hurricane Electric](https://bgp.he.net/) / [BGP Tools](https://bgp.tools/) |
| Content Archives | Archived content of websites on the IP or screenshots of the services on the IP and may show earlier branding, contact info, or domains before a site changed. | [URLscan](https://urlscan.io/) / [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) / [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) / [SilentPush](https://www.silentpush.com/) / [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) |

| Code Repositories | Search in code repositories for references to the IP as the developers sometimes hardcode IPs in their code and configuration files. | [GitHub](https://github.com/) / [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) |
| Linked to Tor Nodes, VPNs, or Proxies | Checking in lists of Tor, VPNs, or Proxy nodes suggests the IP is not owned by a specific end-user but part of a privacy or anonymisation network. | [TOR Node List](https://dev.dan.me.uk/tornodes) / [IPQS](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/) / [Spur](https://spur.us/context/me) / [IP2PROXY](https://www.ip2proxy.com/) |

| IP Behaviours | Honeypot networks and crowdsourced reporting sites can also help discern what an IP is doing and who owns it based on it's observed interactions with honeypot and victim IPs. | [GreyNoise](https://viz.greynoise.io/) / [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/) / [CrowdSec](https://app.crowdsec.net/cti) / [Project Honeypot](https://www.projecthoneypot.org/list_of_ips.php) |
| Security TXT Records| Querying the IP directly can reveal the security TXT file at .well_known/security.txt or /security.txt paths on a host ip. DNS implementations also exist for security TXT files, these can be found as DNS TXT records.  | [Browserling](https://www.browserling.com/) / [Mxtoolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx) / [urlscan](https://urlscan.io) / [security txt](https://securitytxt.org/) / [dns security txt](https://dnssecuritytxt.org/) |

| NetFlow | NetFlow captures metadata about traffic flows (source/destination IPs, ports, protocol, timestamps) and can be used to track communication patterns, peer IPs, and usage behavior. Repeated traffic between an IP and a corporate network could indicate ownership. | [Team Cymru Pure Signal](https://www.team-cymru.com/) |
| Breach Data | Breach Data includes leaked credentials, config files, and service records from compromised systems and could be used to directly connect an IP to an email address, domain, or username and imply corporate ownership. | [SpyCloud](https://spycloud.com/) / [AmIBreached](https://amibreached.com/) / [Intelx](https://intelx.io/) / [Dehashed](https://dehashed.com/) / [Socradar](https://socradar.io/) / [Hudsonrock](http://hudsonrock.com/) |
